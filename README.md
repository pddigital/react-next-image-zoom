React/Next.js Example: Image Zoom with Vanilla JavaScript

This library demonstrates how to create a light-weight image zoom for an eccommerce site using plain javascript (no libraries!) and React.
I'm using the Next.js framework for server-side rendering, but this example should also work for normal React.
The CSS is being handled by Styled-JSX, which comes with Next, but can be easily ported to other CSS preprocessors.

To start: ```npm run dev``` then navigate to localhost:3000 in your browser.
