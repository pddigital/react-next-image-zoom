React/Next.js Example: Image Zoom with Vanilla JavaScript

This library demonstrates how to create an image zoom for an eccommerce site using plain javascript and React.
I'm using the Next.js framework for server-side rendering, but this example should also work for normal React.
The CSS is being handled also by Styled-JSX, which comes with Next, but can be easily ported to other CSS preprocessors.
